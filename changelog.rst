Changelog

0.5 (18-Dec-2015)
-----------------

- New cmake functionality allows package creators to provide cmake finders, so that package consumers
  can use their CMakeLists.txt with typical FindXXX.cmake files, without any change to them. CMake CONAN_CMAKE_MODULES_PATH
  added, so that package creators can provide any additional cmake scripts for consumers.
- Now it is possible to generate out-of-source and multiple configuration installations for the
  same project, so you can switch between them without having to ``conan install`` again. Check :ref:`the new workflows<workflows>`
- New qmake generator (thanks @dragly)
- Improved removal/deletion of folders with shutil.rmtree, so ``conan remove`` commands and other
  processes requiring deletion of folders do not fail due to permissions and require manual deletion.
  This is an improvement, especially in Win.
- Created ``pip`` package, so conan can be installed via: ``pip install conan``
- Released ``pyinstaller`` code for the creation of binaries from conan python source code. Distros package creators can
  create packages for the conan apps easily from those binaries.
- Added md5, sha1, sha256 helpers in ``tools``, so external downloads from ``conanfile.py`` files ``source()``
  can be checked.
- Added latest gcc versions to default ``settings.yml``
- Added CI support for conan development: travis-ci, appveyor
- Improved human-readability for download progress, help messages.
- Minor bug fixes
