Changelog
=========

Check https://github.com/conan-io/conan for issues and more details about development, contributors, etc.

0.9.2 (11-May-2016)
-------------------
- **Fixed download bug** that made it specially slow to download, even crash. Thanks to github @melmdk for fixing it.
- **Fixed cmake check of CLang**, it was being skipped
- **Improved performance**. Check for updates has been removed from install, made it opt-in in ``conan info`` command, as it
  was very slow, seriously affecting performance of large projects.
- Improved internal representation of graph, also improves performance for large projects.
- Fixed bug in ``conan install --update``


0.9 (3-May-2016)
-------------------

- **Python 3** "experimental" support. Now the main conan codebase is Python 2 and 3 compatible. 
  Python 2 still the reference platform, Python 3 stable support in next releases.
- Create and share your **own custom generators for any build system or tool**. With "generator packages",
  you can write a generator just as any other package, upload it, modify and version it, etc. Require
  them by reference, as any other package, and pull it into your projects dynamically.
- **Premake4** initial experimental support via a generator package. Check https://www.conan.io/source/PremakeGen/0.1/memsharded/testing
- Very large **re-write of the documentation**. New "creating packages" sections with in-source and out-source explicit examples.
  Please read it! :)
- Improved ``conan test``. Renamed ``test`` to ``test_package`` both for the command and the folder,
  but backwards compatibility remains. Custom folder name also possible. 
  **Adapted test layout** might require minor changes to your package test, 
  automatic warnings added for your convenience.
- Upgraded pyinstaller to generate binary OS installers from 2.X to 3.1
- ``conan search`` now has command line options:, less verbose, verbose, extra verbose
- Added variable with full list of dependencies in conanbuildinfo.cmake
- Several minor bugfixes (check github issues)
- Improved ``conan user`` to manage user login to multiple remotes


0.8.4 (28-Mar-2016)
-------------------

- Fixed linker problems with the new apple-clang 7.3 due to libraries with no setted timestamp.
- Added apple-clang 7.3 to default settings
- Fixed default libcxx for apple-clang in auto detection of base conan.conf


0.8 (15-Mar-2016)
-----------------

- New **conan remote** command to manage remotes. Redesigned remotes architecture, now allows
  to work with several remotes in a more consistent, powerful and "git-like" way. New remotes
  registry keeps track of the remote of every installed package, and this information is shown
  in ``conan info`` command too. Also, it keeps different user logins for different remotes, to
  improve support in corporate environments running in-house servers.
- New **update** functionality. Now it is possible to ``conan install --update`` to update packages
  that became obsolete because new ones were uploaded to the corresponding remote. Conan commands
  as install and info show information about the status of the local packages compared with the
  remote ones. In this way, using latest versions during development is much more natural.
- Added new **compiler.libcxx** setting in order to support the different c++ standard libraries.
  It can take libstdc++, libstdc++11 or libc++ values to take into account different standard
  libraries for modern gcc and clang compilers. It is also possible to remove not needed settings,
  like this one in pure C projects, with the new syntax: ``del self.settings.compiler.libcxx``
- Conan **virtual environment**: Define a custom conan directory with **CONAN_USER_HOME** env variable,
  and have a per project or per workspace storage for your dependencies. So you can isolate your
  dependencies and even bundle them within your project, by just setting the CONAN_USER_HOME
  variable to your ``<project>/deps`` folder, for example. This also improves support for continuous
  integration CI systems, in which many builds from different users could be run in parallel.
- Better conanfile download method. More stable and now checks (opt-out) the **ssl certificates**.
- Lots of improvements: Increased library name length limit, Improved and cleaner output messages.
- Fixed several minor bugs: removing empty folders, case sensitive exports, arm settings detection.
- Introduced the concept of **"package recipe"** that refers to conanfile.py and exported files.
- Improved settings display in web, with new "copy install command to clipboard" to assist in
  installing packages discovered in web.
- The OSX installer, problematic with latest OSX releases, has been deprecated in favour
  of homebrew and pip install procedures.



0.7 (5-Feb-2016)
----------------

- Custom conanfile names are allowed for developing. With ``--file`` option you can define
  the file you want to use, allowing for ``.conaninfo.txt`` or having multiple ``conanfile_dev.py``,
  ``conanfile_test.py`` besides the standard ``conanfile.py`` which is used for sharing the package.
  Inheritance is allowed, e.g. ``conanfile_dev.py`` might extend/inherit from ``conanfile.py``.
- New ``conan copy`` command that can be used to copy/rename packages, promote them between channels,
  forking other users packages.
- New ``--all`` and ``--package`` options for ``conan install`` that allows to download one, several,
  or all package configurations for a given reference.
- Added ``patch()`` tool to easily patch sources if necessary.
- New **qmake** and **qbs** generators
- Upload of conanfile **exported** files is also **tgz'd**, allowing fast upload/downloads of
  full sources if desired, avoiding retrieval of sources from externals sources.
- ``conan info`` command improved showing info of current project too
- Output of ``run()`` can be redirected to buffer string for processing, or even removed.
- Added **proxy** configuration to conan.conf for users behinds proxies.
- Large improvements in commands output, prefixed with package reference, and much clear.
- Updated settings for more versions of gcc and new arm architectures
- Treat dependencies includes as SYSTEM in cmake, so no warnings are raised
- Deleting source folder after ``conan export`` so no manual removal is needed
- Normalizing to CRLF generated user files in Win
- Better detection and checks for compilers as VS, apple-clang
- Fixed CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS typo in cmake files
- Large internal refactor in generators


0.6 (11-Jan-2016)
-----------------

- New cmake variables in cmake generator to make FindPackage work better thanks to the underlaying FindLibrary. Now many FindXXX.cmake work "as-is" and the package creator does not have to create a custom override, and consumers can use packages transparently with the originals FindXXX.cmakes
- New "conan info" command that shows the full dependency graph and details (license, author, url, dependants, dependencies) for each dependency.
- New environment helper with a ConfigureEnvironment class, that is able to translate conan information to autotools configure environment definition
- Relative importing from conanfiles now is possible. So if you have common functionality between different packages, you can reuse those python files by importing them from the conanfile.py. Note that export="..." might be necessary, as packages as to be self-contained.
- Added YouCompleteMe generator for vim auto-completion of dependencies.
- New "conanfile_directory" property that points to the file in which the conanfile.py is located. This helps if using the conanfile.py "build" method to build your own project as a project, not a package, to be able to use any workflow, out-of-source builds, etc.
- Many edits and improvements in help, docs, output messages for many commands.
- All cmake syntax in modern lowercase
- Fixed several minor bugs: gcc detection failure when gcc not installed, missing import, copying source->build failing when symlinks


0.5 (18-Dec-2015)
-----------------

- New cmake functionality allows package creators to provide cmake finders, so that package consumers
  can use their CMakeLists.txt with typical FindXXX.cmake files, without any change to them. CMake CONAN_CMAKE_MODULES_PATH
  added, so that package creators can provide any additional cmake scripts for consumers.
- Now it is possible to generate out-of-source and multiple configuration installations for the
  same project, so you can switch between them without having to ``conan install`` again. Check :ref:`the new workflows<workflows>`
- New qmake generator (thanks @dragly)
- Improved removal/deletion of folders with shutil.rmtree, so ``conan remove`` commands and other
  processes requiring deletion of folders do not fail due to permissions and require manual deletion.
  This is an improvement, especially in Win.
- Created ``pip`` package, so conan can be installed via: ``pip install conan``
- Released ``pyinstaller`` code for the creation of binaries from conan python source code. Distros package creators can
  create packages for the conan apps easily from those binaries.
- Added md5, sha1, sha256 helpers in ``tools``, so external downloads from ``conanfile.py`` files ``source()``
  can be checked.
- Added latest gcc versions to default ``settings.yml``
- Added CI support for conan development: travis-ci, appveyor
- Improved human-readability for download progress, help messages.
- Minor bug fixes
