Conan Package Tools
===================

We have developed a new tool for:

    - Make easier the **generation of multiple conan's packages** with different configurations.
    - Automated/remote package generation in **Travis/Appveyor** server with distributed builds in CI jobs for big/slow builds.
    - **Docker**: Automatic generation of packages for gcc 4.6, 4.8, 4.9, 5.2 and 5.3 in any Linux, also in Travis CI.
    - **Visual Studio**: Automatic configuration of command line environment with detected settings.

Its available in pypi:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install conan_package_tools
